# FFBE 2nd Anniversary Event Hard Exploration Dungeon

This event's title is self-explanatory. They are giving rate up for the CG versions of the main characters. Managed to get most of them(except Fina, sobs) so this event turned out easier than the usual events. Also, it is much easier to get lots of tokens to exchange for stuff at the King Moogle, Kupo!

## Mob Fights
Pretty easy if you have 1 or 2 top tier attackers that can mob well. In my case, I brought Sephiroth and Onion Knight. Also, I had CG Nichol t buff and recover MP just in case. Otherwise, equip something that gives you escape ability to run away from fights.

## Boss Ochu
Spams strong AoE Physical attacks at some point. Have Warrior of Light's "Light is with Us!" or Earth Veritas' "Guardian" up at all times. Provoke it if you want to draw away more attacks from other units.

It is weak to Fire and Ice. 2x Onion Knights would be good here as they can use AoE to clear all the seedlings fast and deal more damage using his Fire attacks.

DEF and SPR debuffs works! Use it to bring it down faster.

## Team Line-Up
