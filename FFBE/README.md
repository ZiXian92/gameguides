## Description/Disclaimer
These guides are purely based on my experience in these boss fights. Main strategy comes from [FFBE究極攻略Wiki](https://altema.jp/ffbe/). The site is all in Japanese, so it takes some Japanese language skills to understand.  

Note that I am playing theJapanese version of the game. So some of the guides may not be applicable to global version yet, but will be useful when they come out in the global version.
