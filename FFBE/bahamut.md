Bahamut is one of the first Espers that the producers decided to make a hard content. All 2-star and above Espers released subsequently are at least as hard as this one. Wonder what it will be like if Bahamut ever gets a 2-star form.

## 1-star
### Team Roles
**Magic AoE tank** is a MUST! this is the 1st content where this role is essential to not losing the fight. Mystea is a good candidate for this with her Tritelia Wall. Use this ONLY for Megaflare! You don't want her to die right before the Megaflare comes.  

**Strong Healer with Re-raise ability** is also important. As I have none of such units, I was lucky to find a friend using CG Fina as leader. Her job is to prioritize Cureja, and then casting Re-raise on herself, followed by other support units if there is no need for Cureja that turn.  

**Debuffer** helps to lower incoming damage. Important for non-Megaflare turns as AoE magic attacks becomes more frequent with lower HP. In my first successful fight, I had no Warrior of Light so I used Noctis' Thunder Flask to debuff its MAG stat. Also, in that same fight, I had Ace to reduce its Fire elemental resistance so that my Onion Knight can deal more damage.  

**Mitigator:** If your team is weak like mine, Rikku is very useful here. Hyper NulAll significantly reduces damage on non-Megaflare turns, keeping Mystea alive most of the time and cutting down on turns wasted having Noctis use Full Recover. Time the usage of Hyper NulAll and Mix right so that Hyper NulAll is at your disposabal when you need it.  

**MP healer** will be useful here since the fight is usually long(unless you have a one-punch team ready). I had Ace's Spirit Deck fully awakened to increase the average MP recovered.  

**Attacker:** Nothing needs to be said...

### My Team Line-Up
* Mystea(ミステア)
  * Equip with Paralysis immunity. 
  * Equip her with as much SPR stat as you can. Shee MUST survive all those AoE magic attacks so that she can use Tritelia Wall(ブローディアウォール) to tank that Megaflare.
* Rikku(リュック)
  * Equip with Paralysis immunity.
* Noctis(ノクティス)
  * Equip with Paralysis immunity.
* Ace(エース)/Warrior of Light(光の戦士)
  * Equip with Paralysis immunity.
* Onion Knight(たまねぎ剣士)
* Friend CG Fina(白蓮フィーナ)
  * Equip with Paralysis immunity.

### HP Threshold(s)
* 100%: Megaflare
* 20%: Megaflare. Does not disrupt the Megaflare cycle. Not sure if this will be a double cast if triggerred on a Megaflare turn. Please time this threshold well.

### Pattern
Bahamut attacks on a 4-turn cycle. After each Megaflare, except the 20% HP threshold, there will be a 3-turn countdown to the next one. Each of these 3 turns, it will inflict AoE paralysis when the countdown number appears at the top. Also, it will cast a variety of AoE elemental magic attacks and basic attacks in each of these turns. Put up Hyper NulAll during/after the Megaflare turn.
