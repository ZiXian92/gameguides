## Notes
Despite its small and cute appearance, it is actually a tough esper to clear without digging up guides or its attack mechanisms.

## 1-star
Not trivial but not too hard. Can't remember how it went but some defensive buffs should get you through.

## 2-star
Hard for a 2-star esper, though not as hard as Leviathan 2-star. Can't remember what happened when I cleared it too. Best to refer to Altema guide.

## 3-star
Nonsensically hard. Took about the same amount of time, if not more, than when I cleared Shiva 3-star.

### Team Roles
**Magic AoE tank** such as Shield or Mystair should be equipped with at least 200% Light elemental resistance plus as high SPR as possible. I could only hit 200% Light resistance with some elemental resistance buff. I think a near 1000 SPR is needed to survive all the non-elemental magic attacks when it goes crazy. My Shield always died on such turns. Also, make sure Tritelia Wall is active on all turns as much as possible.

**Stop resistance buffer** is needed to avoid getting Stop status, which is bad if it falls on buffer/tank/healer. Shield and Mystair both provide such buff. This buff has higher precedence than Tritelia Wall. If worried, cast Light resistance buff to not die from Punishga in the meanwhile.

**Healer with Re-raise magic/ability** is another must. Ideally, you should have Ayaka/CG Fina fill this role as they can Dualcast Reraise and have Curaja. Make sure the healer is immune to Silence as it can strike when you need to heal the most. In my case, I used Rem as I have neither of the ideal healers. Note that Rem's Undying Wish cannot be dualcasted and she has no Esunaga nor Curaja.

**Dispel user** is needed unless your tank is strong enough to tank all of Carbuncle's attacks when it gives itself MAG up buff(it's an extreme increase!). Details on when to use it will be discussed later. In my case, I had Re fill this role as well.

**Provoker** is just there to tank all the Deaths thrown by Carbuncle so very often. I had Warrior of Light fill this role. The Provoke buff should last as long as possible(mmy Brave Presence only lasts 2 turns as it is not maxed out). Warrior of Light can also mitigate damage taken with Arms Eraser. Also, equip with Genji's Shield or Safety Bit to negate Death.

**Buffer** is definitely desirable as you need all the defensive buffs you can get and also offensive buffs when the chance to hit hard arises. CG Nichol is a good choice as he can do a wide variety of useful stacking buffs(SPR up, damage mitigation, elemental resistance, Heal over time etc.).

**MP Healer**: It's going to be a VERY long fight. I don not know about double Lilla combo, but my double Sakura combo could only do about 10-15% HP damage each time its SPR drops drastically. If your units' MP run dry, you should just quit the fight. Here, I have CG Nichol recover most of the MP, with Sakura as secondary MP healer if CG Nichol becomes overstretched from all the buffing.

**Attackers**: Use only those that uses Carbuncle's SPR stat for defense calculation. The only exception here is Setzer. I used my own and a friend's CG Sakura to trigger mode change and also deal high damage with Rebel Intention.

### My Team Line-Up
* Shield
  * All sorts of Light elemental resistance equips
  * 4x Minfilla's Trust Master enhanced
  * Carbuncle 2-star
  * Total Light resistance 155%
* Warrior of Light
  * Genji's Shield
  * 210's Trust Master(15% HP/SPR, chance to heal on taking magic damage)
* Rem
  * Ribbon(Kefka's Trust Master)
  * Dispel
* CG Nichol
* CG Sakura
* Friend CG Sakura

### HP Thresholds
Nothing serious, just healing itself for 1.5m.

### Pattern
Mode Change triggered by 2 Dark attacks each(sometimes it proceeds to the next stage when I am recovering instead of attacking).  
Stage 1 Mode Change: Dark resistance up and removes magic reflect for 2 turns. Have Tritelia Wall and Stop resistance buffs up. Keep magic tank HP up and have Reraise casted on it.  
Stage 2: Massive MAG up and SPR down. It first buffs itself and then throws a whole bunch of single-target magic attacks and some AoE magic attacks. The former hits for a lot and is what kills the magic tank. The latter is survivable with Light resistance buff and magic tank alive to receive it before dying from more of the former. On the next turn, buff the attackers and spam your best magic damage. After the attackers have attacked, use Dispel to remove its MAG buff and then revive the magic tank.

### My Strategy
Shield: Alternate between Interception and Tritelia Wall. Make sure Tritelia Wall is up on Stage 2. If this condition is met, use Interception on that turn to prolong the Stop resistance. If there is a free turn, Limit Burst can be used to mitigate some damage on the others.

Warrior of Light: Alternate between Brave Presence and Arms Eraser. If you feel the Stage 2 coming soon, prioritise Brave Presence. Then, use Arms Eraser on the turn after Stage 2. This is because you want to have its MAG reduced after Dispel is used but if this results in Provoke buff not active, Death can hit any of the other units, wrecking the strategy. I almost lost due to this and spent many turns with only Rem and Warrior of Light surviving just to slowly bring back my tank, buffer and finally attackers.

Rem: Primarily healing and reviving. Right before triggering Stage 1, cast Undying Wish on magic tank. Subsequently, cast Undying Wish on any units you do not wish to have dead. On the turn after Stage 2, after the attackers have attacked, use Dispel and revive magic tank. Beware of Reflect being casted on party members as it will make Curega useless. In this case, I used Nichol's heal-over-time buff too(heals for a lot each turn actually, but high MP cost).

Nichol: Alternate between mitigation, Light elemental resistance, and SPR buffs. Slot in MP recovery whenever possible due to his high MP usage. Use his all-stat buff plus heal-over-time on the turn after Stage 2 if most units are at low health as Rem will be unable to heal due to Dispel and Raise duty. Also, on the turn after Stage 2, buff the attackers so they can bring end the fight faster.

Sakuras: When not ready to survive Carbuncle's triggers, refrain from using Dark attacks! Instead, relief Nichol by doing mitigation, MP healing, and/or Light resistance buffs. Or, normal attack to build up Limit Burst gauge. Limit Burst hits harder than Rebel Intention. Use the cheapest Dark attacks to trigger so that MP remains enough for dualcasting Rebel Intention. On the turn after Stage 2, either have both dualcast Rebel Intention or both Limit Burst(80+ hit chain!).

### Video
No video as it took too long that I cannot record the whole thing as I was travelling home while challenging this fight :(
