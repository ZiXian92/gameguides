Diablos, as a boss, is well-known for its devastating HP-cutting abilities like Graviga and instant-death ability Death. Coupled with a number of other attacks, it can wipe your team if you are not prepared for what you will be facing.

## 1-star
Keep a lookout for Graviga and Death(counter with 100% Provoke with Genji's Shield or Safety Bit). Otherwise it can be easily burst down.

## 2-star
Similar to 1-star but prepare units that can heal and revive as any follow-up to Graviga will likely lead to death. Still not too hard that it warrants a detailed guide.

## 3-star
Diablos is unexpectedly tanky here, similar to Ifrit and Shiva, but definitely not as tanky as Carbuncle. Most notable are AoE Dark magic attacks, frequent Death and single-target physical attacks.

### Team Build
**AoE magic tank** is essential here as there are not many equipments that boost Dark resistance. Plus, it's always better to have 1 unit die in place of everyone :) Just make sure it has at least 100% Dark resistance. There is Dark resistance debuff!  

**Stop and Paralyze resistance:** From time to time, Diablos may use *Blackout*, an AoE skill that inflicts Paralysis and Stop. Here, Mystair is an AoE magic tank that can also give buff to negate status ailments and Stop.  

**Perfect dodge provoker with death-resist:** Diablos often casts *Death* and a physical attack that does very high damage. Provoker like Warrior of Light will channel all these attacks to itself. Equipping with Genji's Shield or Safety Bit ensures *Death* will not work while 100% evasion equip counters the high-power physical attacks.  

**Healer with auto-revive ability:** Unless the magic tank has at least 200% Dark resist(I hope this is enough), once debuffed on Dark resist, the tank will not survive *Shadow Impact*. Auto-revive ensures that AoE magic cover can be up at all times. Additionally, in some unfortunate case, the Provoker may die from some weird magic attacks too. Units like CG Fina and Ayaka are recommended.  

**MP healer** is not really needed but in my case my attackers are MP-thirsty. With only CG Fina to recover MP, I had to slow down by having my attackers do nothing in order to build up MP for chain combo attacks.  

**High output** attackers are really important if you do not want to waste your time on this. Strong Light elemental chainers are rare, so I stuck with Rinoa's *Tornado* chaining. The damage output is really bad but at least it makes observable progress on the health bar.

## My Team Line-Up
* Warrior of Light(High evasion equip, Genji's Shield, 3-star Tetra Sylpheed to complete 100% evasion)
* Mystair(High Dark-resist build, 2-star Diablos for more Dark resist)
* CG Fina
* Rinoa 7-star
* Friend Rinoa 7-star

### Strategy
Make sure Mystair has *Tritelia Wall* up at ALL times, followed by *Clear Veil* to guard against *Blackout*.  

For Warrior of Light, his only job is to keep *Brave Presence* up at ALL times.  

From my experience, seems like Mystair dies every 3 turns or from thresholds. So at times, to try to speed up the fight, I had CG Fina recover Rinoa's MP instead of auto-reviving Mystair on the turn after Mystair revives. Otherwise, try to keep auto-revive up on Mystair, Warrior of Light and herself. When LB gauge is full, use LB instead of auto-revive for the same effect on the entire team.  

Rinoa's main job is to use Double Tornado chaining. When CG Fina is ocupied with other stuff, Rinoa can Revive and Heal too! With the defensive setups in place, it is possible to slow down and recover MP when MP is low. For some reason, it is said that should buff offensive stats when nearing 50% HP but to me, that didn't change anything as my damage output is still low except for the Triple Tornado right after *Valia*.
