# FFVIII Event Dole Exploration Dungeon

Compared to the FFVII event's exploration dungeon, this felt easier. Or maybe it is because I have obtained more good units to cheese throught the boss fight :)

## Team Build
**AoE physical tank** makes surviving much easier here. All of the boss' attacks are physical, with several of them being AoE. WOuld recommend going for perfect dodge build on the tank though.  

**Debuffer** is an optional alternative if you lack the tankiness and do not have perfect dodge. The boss can be debuffed on ATK, DEF and SPR. So this can help speed up the fight too!

**MP healer** makes it possible to sustain high damage output here. There will be several boss fights at various points, in addition to the normal monsters.  

**Magic chainers** seem to be effective against the boss. So here, I went for *Tornado* chaining, again.

## My Team Line-Up
* Warrior of Light(perfect dodge build)
* CG Nichol
* CG Fina
* CG Lid
* Rinoa 7-star
* Friend Rinoa 7-star
