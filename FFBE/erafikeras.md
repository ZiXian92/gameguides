Another of the hard trial contents I managed to clear recently, riding on the success wave from Rinoa's Tornado spamming.

## General Strategy
Despite its hardy defenses, it is supposed to be a quick match. You have to clear it within 8 turns or it will use AoE Death every turn!  

Magic attacks are effective against it and it is weak to Wind element. Therefore, Tornado chaining makes this trial fairly easy.  

Note that in the 8 turns, it can spam a number of AoE physical attacks so a physical tank is needed as well.

## Team Build
**AoE physical tank** is needed here to keep your main damage dealers alive. I would recommend a super tanky or perfect dodge Warrior of Light/Wilhelm/Bash/Vertias of the Earth/Charlotte etc. Here, I used perfect dodge Warrior of Light and I don't even need a healer(just wasting slot and reducing damage output only).  

**Buffer:** You might consider bringing one if you are not confident of the damage output. Here, I used CG Nichol because I want to get the *Clear in 5 turns* achievement.  

**Tornado chainers:** Just bring as many as you can. Equip all of them for high MAG. Nothing else to be said.

## My Team Line-Up
* Warrior of Light(perfect dodge build)
* CG Nichol
* Rinoa 7-star(high MAG build)
* Rydia 6-star(high MAG build)
* Onion Knight 6-star(just for extra chaining)
* Friend Rinoa 7-star(high MAG build)

## Strategy
Have Wrrior of Light keep up *Light is with us!* and *Brave Presence*. CG Nichol only needs to buf MAG and otherwise just heal up MP to sustaint he offense.  

The rest, just spam *Double Tornado*. If you want *Triple*, use *Valia* at the start.
