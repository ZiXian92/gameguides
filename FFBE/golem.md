## Notes
I tried following the general strategy at [Golem 3-star strategy](https://altema.jp/ffbe/hoshisangolem) but seems like my team was too weak to carry this out(each hit deals 5-digit damage). So I went to dig up Youtube videos to see if there are easier strategies. Most videos are in Japanese so I think it is still worth writing my own guide in English here.

## 1-star
No guide needed.

## 2-star
No guide needed.

## 3-star
This guide describes sure no-lose strategy hinging on perfect dodge Chizuru and Veritas of the Earth's Earth elemental coverage.

### Team Roles
**Chizuru** is one of the main reasons none of my party members died. With 100% dodge rate and Provoke, all sinle-target attacks will go to Chizuru and she will just dodge them all :) Details of the set up in the next section.  

**Veritas of the Earth** is another important asset here. Earthen Ward gives everyone else 100% Earth elemental resistance so Golem's AoE Earth elemental attack will do NO damage! As for herself, her trait Earth Lord lets her absorb all incoming Earth elemental damage so she is also safe. I had TetraSylpheed equipped to her but didn't summon it on the winning turn. Wasted one quest achievement here...

**Bushido Freedom** is the 3rd and the last piece needed for perfect survival. On the turn after being inflicted with Earth elemental resistance down. Use Bushido Freedom on YOUR OWN TEAM to remove all buffs/debuffs. Then set up Provoke and Earthen Ward again. The cue is when Golem does this Quake-like attack(not Magnitude 8!). I had Roselia cast this as her ATK stat is low so the damage will not be high enough to endanger my team.

**Magic attackers** are preferred over physical attackers as Golem has high DEF but low SPR. A double Lira chain combo on the correct turn after some set up will definitely speed up the fight A LOT. Unfortunately, I have none so I used double Victoria with a friend Sephiroth.

**MP healers** can be considered if you know your damage output is going to be shit and thus the fight will drag for a long time. Running out on MP is the last thing you ever want in an important fight, especially for key units like Chizuru, Veritas of the Earth and Bushido Freedom caster. Here I used Roselia's White Energy for 40MP recovery.

### My Team Line-Up
* Chizuru(チヅル)
  * Passive ability 空弾 fully awakened: 40% evasion rate
  * Sword Breaker(ソードブレイカー): 5% evasion rate from 危険回避
  * Moggle Soft Toy(モグリぬいぐるみ) Elise's trust Mastery: 30% Provoke
  * Producer Jacket(プロデューサージャケット): 20% Provoke
  * 10-sided Dice(１０面ダイス) Sazh's Trust Mastery: 20% evasion rate from 物理攻撃回避
  * Ring of Luci(光耀の指輪) Noctis' Trust Mastery: 25% evasion rate from ホーリー
  * Ida's Trust Mastery upgraded(真・不羈への気焔): 15% evasion rate
  * Ida's Trust Master(不羈への気焔): 10% evasion rate
  * Golem: For Provoke(挑発). 3 turns 70% chance to be targetted.
  * **Total**: 120% Provoke effect when Provoke is used every turn. 115% total evasion rate.
* Veritas of the Earth(王土のヴェリアス)
* Roselia
  * Bushido Freedom(奥義・天下御免)
* 2x Victoria(ビクトリア): For the Overflow chain combo and the ever-increasing damage with each use.
* Friend Sephiroth(セフィロス)
  * Curega(ケアルガ)

### HP Thresholds
Golem has no instant kill nor AoE non-elemental attacks. With this perfect dodge setup, is there a need to care about HP thresholds? :)

### Pattern
At high health, when it casts the Quake-like attack, it is immune to all attacks the next turn. Use this turn to clean all debuffs and rebuff the team.

Normal turns is just all single target attacks, with the occasional AoE Earth elemental attack. Best to have Earthen Ward up EVERY turn if you cannot predict when it is coming.

At low health, the Quake-like attack becomes more frequent, trying to slow down your attack frequency. Slow and steady wins the race here if you cannot one-punch it.
