# Iron Giant Trial

This boss content was released quite long ago, but seeing that the Aigaion fight took me so much trouble to clear with the not-so-good units I had back then(not saying Onion Knight is shit, but I lacked top-class tanks), I did not felt confident that I could clear this.  

However, recently I managed to draw ALL the currently released CG units(yes, that includes top-tier healer Fina and buffer Nichol!), so I felt that maybe I have better chance at clearing it now.  

So here goes...

## Team Build
All units MUST have anti-paralysis! Iron Giant inflicts paralysis EVERY f**king turn when below 50% HP.  

**AoE physical tank** is needed to tank its strong AoE physical attack, which triggers at 80% and 60% HP, and every turn when below 50% HP. Alternatively, one can use Sara's ability buff the entire team with 1 time physical attack evade. For the former, it will be good if the tank is equipped with **100% evade** to cheese it all. I couldn't get my Warrior of Light to 100% evasion as I missed out on all the good equips that might provide evasion during my hiatus :( Nevertheless, RNGsus was kind to me with my 85% evasion.  

**CG Fina**: I am not sure if she is really needed in my attempt, but given that my tank does not have 100% physical evasion, it is possible for my tank to die and I don't want to take my chances. She also serves other purposes mentioned in subsequent points.  

**Dispeller:** Below 50%, 40%, and 20% HP, Iron Giant will buff itself on all stats before spamming with AoE physical attack and enhanced Meteor. To ensure survival next turn, one thing is to remove all these stinking buffs. Here, CG Fina is a convenient unit to have since she can Dualcast Dispelga and Reraise in 1 turn.  

**MP Healer:** Even if the team is capable of one-punching it from 50%HP, the amount of MP consumed to pull this off or even to prepare for this turn is very high(buffs, debuffs, healing, chaining etc.). To make it worse, below 50% HP, Iron Giant drains MP from all units EVERY TURN! My main source of MP recovery here is CG Nichol with his burst MP recovery ability(can be dualcasted for 80MP recovered if there is no need to rebuff during the turn!). Occasionally, I have CG Fina use Manatopeia to recover even more MP.

**Debuffer:** Iron Giant is not immune to any status debuffs, so use this to either increase survivability and/or improve damage efficiency/output. CG Lid is an effcieint debuffer as her Absorb-series abilities reduce the corresponding status by 60%, otherwise if multiple status downs are needed, her Dissolver-series abilities reduce offensive/defensive statuses by 50%. 7-star Ramza also works with his Break-series abilities :)

**Buffer** is kind of optional in my opinion. Helps to cheese the damage taken even more with defensive buff or burst down the boss' HP with offensive buff. In my case, I think I would have more units dying from Meteor without CG Nichol. He has a 109MP skill that buffs all statuses by 100% and heal-over-time for 2 turns. Plus he has a damage mitigation buff, which can be dualcasted together with the previous skill.  

**Magic attackers** are more recommended here. Most will go for CG Sakura but I doubt I can achieve the millions of damage in 1 hit as I am not good at chaining plus finisher combo. Since I tried this trial during the FFVIII event and got my 7-star Rinoa, I decided to use Tornado chaining for damage. Rinoa has this skill *Valia*, which boosts her MAG stat by 150%, her next magic attack by 300% and unlocks *Triple* for 3 turns. Triple Tornado allows for long chains, which will deal a lot of damage in addition to the Wind element debuff from the first Tornado. One thing to note is that I only tried when I can bring a friend with 7-star Rinoa that has 1k+ MAG stat as 600+ MAG is till too weak.  

## My Team Line-Up
* Warrior of Light: Anti-paralysis, 100% evade(if possible), high HP and SPR(if possible). 3-star Golem for more DEF and damage mitigation on summon.
* CG Nichol: Anti-paralysis, high HP, MP and SPR.
* CG Lid: Same as  Nichol.
* CG Fina: Same as Nichol.
* Rinoa(7-star): Anti-paralysis(innate), high MP and MAG(decent HP and SPR is welcome if possible). 3-star Ramuh for higher MAG.
* Friend Rinoa: Same requirements as my own.

## Strategy
Metoer is casted EVERY turn, so have Lid use MAG debuff(should last 3 turns) right at the 1st turn. Next, use ATK debuff in case HP threshold is triggered. The, use SPR debuff and start dealing good damage with Tornado chaining. This is more or less the cycle for Lid. More on what to do when Dispel is used later.  

Warrior of Light is mainly for *Light is with us!*, so have that up on ALL turns just in case. Otherwise, he can also help out with debuffs using his Eraser abilities. Else, guard.  

Fina's role is mainly to heal and make sure Warrior of Light is still alive on the next turn(through Reraise if needed). Otherwise, Manatopeia is a good choice. Lastly, use Dispelga when Iron Giant buffs itself. Use LB to Reraise everyone when pushing past 50% HP.  

For Nichol, the main buffs needed are all statuses 100% up, heal-over-time, and damage mitigation(30%). The first 2 are handled by this 109MP skill that lasts for 2 turns and the last is a 32MP skill that lasts for 3 turns. Since these and his MP recovery skill can be dualcasted, always dualcast to get the most out of each turn. Use MP recovery as much as possible whenever the buffs are up.  

As Tornado has relatively high MP cost and Rinoa has low MP when not at max level, it is best to save the Double/Triple Tornado for after Lid has used Mind Absorb. At above 50% HP, stick to Double Tornado, making sure to only cross 80% and 60% HP thresholds on different turns. Also, stop spamming magic damage when nearing 50% HP to allow time to set up for Triple Tornado burst. The setup involves using Valia on 1 turn and then unlocking Triple for the next 3 turns.  

After Dispelling Iron Giant, there are 2 options: finish it in this turn or set up to try to survive the 40% and 20% HP thresholds. In my case, I chose the first one as it was already at 19% HP(down from 46%) after my Triple Tornado. So here, I had Lid use Mind Absorb to boost damage output. Otherwise, use Magic Absorb or if Warrior of Light has his AoE tank buff up, use Mind Absorb and Arms Eraser to get both increased damage output and reduced damage received.
