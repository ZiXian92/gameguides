This is my first time attempting the HARD level of an event's exploration dungeon. Usually I go in without referring to any guides and get REKT. Since I am putting up this guide, of course it means I finally cleared it.

## Notes/Disclaimers
If you can bring in a full team of 5 top-tier attackers/chainers, you probably DON'T NEED this guide. Don't waste your time here. This is for the ordinary folks with mediocre luck.

## Team Roles
**Attackers/Chainers** are still the bread and butter of any boss content. In this case, if you think your best chaining damage is still not enough to finish the boss in 1 turn, keep at most 2 attackers if you want to get Sephiroth's Coat by clearing with only 5 units. Here I used 2 Sephiroths as he can relieve some of the burden of reviving units off my healer.

**Bushido Freedom** or being able to Dispel your attackers is necessary to keep up the damage. Hellfire gives all your physical attacks Fire element, which it is immune to, making your damage effectively 0. Just make sure whoever casts Bushido Freedom does not end up killing important units instead.  

**Magic AoE tank with at least 100% Fire elemental resistance** makes the fight much more bearable. Hellfire did NO damage to my Shield, though he keeps getting killed by トライン.

**Reviver and Re-raiser** are important in supporting the main attackers and tanks. This is especially so if your magic tank dies from トライン like mine. Sadly, Rem is the only unit I have who can use something like Re-raise.

**Perfect-dodge Chizuru** is a pretty nice fit to the team. All of the boss' physical attacks are single-target. So most of the attacks will end up going to Chizuru and she will just dodge them all. Note that the boss' counter-attacks are not affected by Provoke, though if you have Golem equipped to Chizuru, she may protect the unit being counter-attacked.

## My Team Line-Up
* Sephiroth
  * No Fire elemental weapons please!
* Chizuru
  * Equip and awakened for 100% evasion
  * Equip for at least 30% Provoke rate
  * Equip Golem to shield ally randomly and also for 70% Provoke skill
* Shield
  * Equip for 100% Fire element
  * Equipped with Phoenix(turned out he was the only survivor of an onslaught went wrong and so could use Phoenix to revive everyone else :))
* Rem
* Friend Sephiroth
  * Similar description as mine

## Pattern
* Every turn: Counter-attacks if hit with physical attacks that turn. Counter-magic attacks if hit with Magic that turn. Random attacks and occassionally Hell Combo.
* Every 3 turns: トライン, an AoE non-elemental Magic attack that hits really hard.
* Every ?? turns: Hellfire.

## Strategy
Prioritize the 3-turn pattern! Make sure Tritelia Wall is up by that turn and Re-raise your magic tank! In my case, Rem is my Dispeller, so even if I got hit by Hellfire on a 2nd turn, I will still prioritize Re-raising Shield for the next turn as he is sure to die from トライン.  

Order of actions matter when Dispelling your team! Don't be dumb like me: using Bushido Freedom after Tritelia Wall has been casted that turn and getting rekt hard that fight.  

At low health, I cannot explain what happened to the boss but somehow one of its Hell Combo slipped past my evasion and killed Chizuru, nearly causing my entire team to get wiped that turn and the next.
