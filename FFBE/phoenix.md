At first sight, I thought the 1 and 2-star fights would be easy, as with most other espers. However, they posed some challenges and I was a little unprepared. But thankfully they were still manageable even without looking at the guide in FFBE Altema.

## 1-star
Not exactly easy but still pretty easy given that my normal team only has 1 Sephiroth as attacker and the rest all supporting roles.

### Team Roles
**Magic AoE tank** is still needed. Phoenix uses a lot of single-target and AoE Fire and Earth elemental magic each turn. Mystea/Shilt's Tritelia Wall, coupled with some Barfira, should be enough to significantly cut down the damage taken.

**Debuffer** helps to speed up the fight. Phoenix is vulnerable to all status debuffs.

### My Team Line-Up
* Shilt(シルト)
* Echo(エーコ)
* Ramza(ラムザ)
* Warrior of Light(光の戦士)
* Sephiroth(セフィロス)

## 2-star
This one is a little harder than the 1-star fight as it is significantly tougher to bring down and also I did not look up on how to stop certain mechanisms to speed up the fight. The only preparation I did was to give Shilt 100% Fire elemental resistance, which I thought was enough but turned out not really enough. Nevertheless, I managed to clear it in about an hour...

# Team Roles
**Magic AoE tank**: Cannot stress the important of this role enough for boss fights. As Phoenix uses both Fire and Earth elemental magic attacks, make sure this unit has at least 170% Fire and ideally 100% Earth elemental resistance. In my case, Shilt fills this position. He only had 25% Earth elemental resistance from equipping Phoenix. Coupled with a whopping 70% Fire elemental resistance down, he died about 3 times during the fight. An extra note is that 100% Earth elemental resistance is easily provisioned if you have a slot for Veritas of the Earth to use Earthen Ward.  

**Debuffer** is another useful role in this fight as Phoenix can be debuffed both offensively and defensively. Warrior of Light nicely fits this role with his Arms Eraser and Armor Eraser.  

**Fire damager attacker** is needed here as part of the strategy to stop Phoenix from healing itself. Details to be covered in later section.  

**Water damage attacker** is also needed, similar to Fire damage dealer. Onion Knight covers these 2 roles easily. Additionally, with his Splendor of the Water, he gives everyone 70% Fire elemental resistance. That is why most of the time Shilt was able to block all Fire magic without taking damage.

### My Team Line-Up
* Shilt(シルト)
  * Equip with at least 100% Fire elemental resistance if using Onion Knight's Splendor of the Water for Fire elemental resistance buff, 120% if using Barfira, or 170% otherwise.
* Sephiroth(セフィロス)
* Warrior of Light(光の戦士)
  * I went for the high-evasion build. Not as perfect as the Chizuru one due to lack of equipment providing distinct evasion abilities.
* Ramza(ラムザ)
* Echo(エーコ)
* Friend Onion Knight(たまねぎ剣士)

### HP Threshold
* 40%: Full HP recovery. Read the next section on how to stop it. It did this twice in my fight and somehow I managed to stop the 3rd cast unknowingly.

### Pattern
On usual turns, it throws in a series of physical, Fire and Earth magic attacks. On 3rd turns, this barrage gets worse with addition of Fire Press. General strategy is to have Shilt cast Tritelia Wall on the 1st turn, cast the ability to reduce his damage taken on the 2nd turn, and guard on the 3rd turn. This guarantees his survival with no fatal damage taken.  

It also frequently alternates between 2 different types of Flammable Wing, each  of which reduces the team's Fire resistance by 70% and a different set of its own elemental resistance. When its Fire resistance is reduced, use Fire attacks on it for 3 turns to make it buff itself. Do this when it is near 40% HP so that casting the buff overrides the healing trigger. If your magic tank has enough Fire resistance even after debuff, there is no need to Dispel its buffs.  

When it reduces its elemental resistances, make Onion Knight attack it with the element it is weak to to make it change its Flammable Wing, unless you are trying to stop its healing as described above.
