## Disclaimer
Note that this is an incomplete guide, especially on my actual team composition as I have already forgotten most of the details at the time of writing.

## 1-star
Easy. No guide needed.

## 2-star
Same as 1-star.

## 3-star
### Team Roles
**Magic AoE tank** is a MUST. Recently more and more bosses require such units to survive their ultimate attacks. Here, Mystea shines A LOT. Make sure she is immune to Paralysis and has at least 240% Lightning resistance after applying buffs.  

**Thunder buffer** is essential to hit that minimum requirement of 240% Lightning resistance. Kujah with Barthundara fully awakened is recommended here.  

**Strong healer** with Re-raise ability is highly recommended as with any other hard content. Here, I was fortunate to have a friend CG Fina.

**Water element** attacker helps to speed up the fight since Ramuh is weak against Water element. In my case, Onion Knight(たまねぎ剣士) is my best damage dealer.

**MP Healer** is essential here as Ramuh uses Osmose from time to time. If Mystea gets hit by Osmose, have someone use MP potion on her. Ramza, with fully awakened Hero's Rime(えいゆうのうた), is useful for sustaining/recovering MP, as well as improve survivability with all stats 100% buff.

## My Team Line-Up
* Mystea
* Kujah
* Onion Knight
* Ramza
* ??? (Cannot remember)
* CG Fina (Friend)

Please make sure ALL units are immune to Paralysis so that healer can focus on healing.

## HP Thresholds
* 100%: Lowers Lighting resistance and Paralyzes all.

## Patterns
Thundaja every turn except when it casts Blind+Osmose or Lightning resistance down+Paralyze.  

When HP < 50%, casts 2 AoE Lightning attacks each turn. All tankable by Mystea with Barthundara from Kujah.
