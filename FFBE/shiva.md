### Team Roles
**Magic AoE tank** is a MUST! Candidates are Mystea, Bash, and Shilt. Their job each turn is to case the ability that lets them take all the AoE magic damage to themselves. As these are your main tank, equip them with as much ice-resistance equipment, materia and esper as possible. My Mystea's ice resistance was 190%. With the right in-battle setup, she takes NO damage from Blizzaja at all. Only damage from physical attacks.  

**Physical AoE tank** is another MUST! Candidates are Warrior of Light, Bash, and Charlotte. On the first turn and every 3rd turn, Shiva will cast Shooting Hail, an AoE physical attack that lowers your defences. Except the first turn, have the AoE cover buff up before these turns and guard then she uses this. To deal with the first turn, cast the AoE cover skill and have a healer cast Re-raise on him/her.  
Physical attack evasion is ALSO needed to survive this! Equip this physical tank with lots of evasion-rate increasing equipment and materia. Examples are Hero's shield(from a past event), 10-sided dice(Sazh's trust master), Ida's trust master AND its upgraded form(the different forms stack) obtainable from FFXIV raid events. Some additional defence and elemental resistance is a plus if you can afford the slots.  

**Healers**, needless to say, is also a must. For best survivability, use one with the ability to Re-raise your tank(or itself if no healing is needed that turn). In my case, I used Rem, which I recently drew, as she has Re-raise-like ability 死なないで which I need for the 1st turn.   
Main job: heal and revive only. No luxury of time for anything else. Honest.  

**Buffer/Debuffer** helps improve chances of surviving Shiva's constant onslaught(you may be dead before you can heal otherwise). I recommend Ramza with Hero's Rime(えいゆうのうた) fully awakened as it provides a whopping 100% boost to all stats and recovers HP and MP EVERY TURN for 3 turns. This is essential for keeping up the MP requirements for healer, Mystea, Warrior of Light, and attacker. Good luck if you run out of MP(you can just quit to stop wasting more time).

**Attacker:** If you don't even have one in the team, don't even think about winning. I used a friend's Sephiroth(1.3k attack double-hand 両手持ち build) as he provides other good utility(Araise to revive healer in unfortunate cases) to help recover from poor RNG. He has good survivability as well as he has chance to not die but left with 1HP.  

#### If your team is weak like mine
**Mitigators** like Rikku will be quite a valuable asset. Hyper NulAll gives good 40% all elemental resistance and 30% damage mitigation. In my case, there were times when both Rem and Sephiroth died due to bad RNG, Mega Phoenix can be used to try to save the situation(I was lucky no one died due to RNG when using this as I had no Hyper NulAll buff on). She MUST NOT die at all, otherwise you have to wait at least 2 turns(1 revive, 1 Mix) to get back the mitigation buff.  
If you are confident of your team's tankiness already, put another attacker in this slot instead to get better damage from chaining.

### HP Thresholds
* 100%: Shooting Hail. 死なないで on Warrior of Light. Warrior of Light use Light is with Us!
* 80%: Diamond Dust, Cure(6M HP), cancels all other scheduled attacks for that turn
* 50%: Diamond Dust, Cure(6M HP), cancels all other scheduled attacks for that turn
* 30%: Diamond Dust, Cure(6M HP), cancels all other scheduled attacks for that turn

### Pattern(3-turn cycle)
* 1st and 2nd turn  
**Attacks:** Blizzaja, then normal attacks  
**Actions to take:** Warrior of Light Arms Eraser. Mystea Tritelia Wall. Rikku Hyper NulAll if buff ending, else Mix to make Hyper NulAll available whenever needed. If many units die, Rikku Mega Phoenix. Hero's Rime. rem prioritize heal surviving units, revive attacker later. Attack.  
* 3rd turn  
**Attacks:** Shooting Hail, then Blizzaja and some normal attacks.  
**Actions to take:** Rem spam heal. Mystea Tritelia Wall(will not proc at all, just for precaution only). Guard the rest.

When Shiva's HP < 30%, Blizzaja cast count becomes 2 on all turns.
