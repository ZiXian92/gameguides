## 3-Star
Compared to Titan, which I fought less than a day ago, this was definitely much easier. At least my units were able to tank most of the time and win a slow and steady fight.

### Team Build
**Anti-status equips** is recommended. You do not want Paralysis, Confuse and Petrify on any of the units as this can spoil the momentum. Any other status immunities are a bonus.  

**MP recovery** is essential because from time to time, Tetra Sylpheed drains all MP from a single target. CG Nichol, CG Fina and Ramza are good candidates.  

**AoE magic tank with high Wind resistance** is a must. There will be a strong AoE Wind elemental magic attack EVERY TURN.  

**Physical tank** helps to concentrate all physical attacks to itself for most of the fight, keeping the rest of the team safe. A tanky Warrior of Light or perfect dodge unit with Provoke will do.  

**Dispel** user is needed for when Tetra Sylpheed buffs herself. It is not very likely to survive without removing her buffs.

### My Team Line-Up
* CG Nichol
* CG Fina
* Warrior of Light(Tanky or Perfect Dodge build). Golem esper equipped.
* Mystair(High Wind resistance build)
* Onion Knight 6-Star(High ATK build)
* Friend Onion Knight 7-Star(High Attack build)

### Strategy
**Mystair:** Ensure Tritelia Wall is up on ALL turns. Otherwise, like the turn in which I had to revive her, guard as many units a possible. If there is luxury of turn and friend unit is not immune to hindering status ailments like Petrify, Confuse, Paralysis, cast Clear Veil.  

**Warrior of Light:** Ensure Brave Presence is up on ALL turns, guard otherwise. When passing the 40% HP threshold, summon Golem for the achievement and also physical damage mitigation since there will be no one to tank all the physical hits from this point onwards. Typically, he WILL NOT die unless due to bad RNG or simply low stats.  

**CG Fina:** Auto-revive Mystair, in case bad things happen, heal the party, and more importantly, use Manatopeia to recover MP. Use Limit Burst whenever possible for full party auto-revive. Use Dispelga when Tetra Sylpheed buffs itself. Use Ultima on the finishing turn to score achievement.  

**CG Nichol:** Make sure the all stats up and damage mitigation buffs are up at ALL times. Otherwise, recover MP for everyone as Tetra Sylpheed occassionally drains MP from single target(usually the tank).  

**Onion Knights:** Chain Splendor of the Earth. Nothing else...
