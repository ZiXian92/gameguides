Titan is one of the harder espers to fight in my opinion. It is easy to get wiped if you are not careful and have not read any strategy guide.

## 1-Star
Can't remember anything. Should still be easy.

## 2-Star
Can't remember anything. A bit harder, but should still be manageable if you can read the Altema guide.

## 3-Star
This took me way too many tries before finding the strategy that works for me. Slow and steady fight using CG Sakura didn't work for me as my team was not string enough to tank its multiple AoE magic attacks.  

With the release of Rinoa from the FFVIII event and the success at Iron Giant, I finally cleared this fight with relative ease. The team build and strategy is pretty much the same as that of Iron Giant, with some differences to take note of.

### Team Build
**AoE physical tank** is a must here. The AoE physical attack every turn is too painful for any of my units to survive. Here I used Veritas of the Earth as my main AoE physical tank. A secondary tank is needed for the 2nd half of the fight as VEritas of the Earth will be sacrificed to be kicked out of battle at 50% HP threshold...  

**Provoker** is used to divert away the single-target magic attacks. Since Titan cannot be debuffed on MAG stat, this is actually quite painful, but bearable when I got 500+ SPR on Warrior of Light. Warrior of Light also serves as the AoE tank in the 2nd half of the fight.  

**Auto-reviver** is indispensable here as Veritas of the Earth and Warrior of Light die on almost evry turn :( Since I finally have CG Fina, why not?  

**Dispel** is needed when Titan buffs itself. If you do not, good luck!  

**Damage mitigation buffer** helps even more with survival. I have CG Nichol do this job. It will be even better if there is a free unit equipped with 9S' trust master for extra 40% physical damage mitigation.  

**Debuffers** are also used for survivability and secondarily more damage output. Warrior of Light and Rinoa can easily deal 45% stat cut.

**Magic attackers** is the way to go for dealing damage. Titan often buffs you with Earth element to all physical attacks, so physical attacks mostly heal it instead. I strongly recommend using units that can at least dualcast Tornado, such as 6-star Rydia and 7-star Rinoa.

### My Team Line-Up
* CG Nichol
* CG Fina
* Warrior of Light(High HP and SPR build)
* Veritas of the Earth(High HP and DEF build, with fully awakened Guardian)
* Rinoa 7-star(High MAG build, with some SPR to tank AoE magic. Rakshimi esper as friend Rinoa has no Petrify immunity)
* Friend Rinoa 7-Star(Same as my own Rinoa, but I insisted on using only those with 1k+ MAG for best damage)

### Strategy
The general strategy is to burst it down from 50% HP to 0 with Triple Tornado chaining. In my case, I was not able to but I was able to in the next turn just before it wrecks my team.

For the first half of the fight, prioritize survival. Slow and steady strategy works for this part. MAG debuff > ATK debuff > SPR debuff. Rinoa and Warrior of Light are able to debuff various stats by 45%, making it easy to set up debuffs in 1 turn. For maximal MP and damage efficiency, use Double Tornado chaining only when SPR debuff is active on Titan.

At 80% and 60% HP, it will try to Paralyze and Petrify all units. So prepare status ailment immunity.

When close to 50% HP, stop attacking it and try to build up status ailment immunity, wait for Warrior of Light's Brave Presence to wear off etc. On the turn before the planned burst, have both Rinoas use Valia so that the next turn it is possible to unleash super-powered version of Triple Tornado.  

If you fail to kill if in 1 shot, remember to Dispel it. Debuff its SPR if you are confident of killing it next turn. Otherwise, debuff its ATK so you won't die from AoE physical damage(no guarantee for AoE magic damage though). For the latter case, have Veritas of the Earth provoke it as we are sacrificing him/her away. For the rest of the fight, Warrior of Light will be tanking all AoE physical damage. At the same time, make sure to keep up status ailment immunity.
