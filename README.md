# Game Guides
A noob, free-to-play player's guide to clearing some of the hard game bosses.

## How to use
Look for the folder whose name corresponds to the game you wish to look at. All the guides I have for that game are in there.

## FAQs
**Q:** The guide for the boss/content I am looking for is not there.  

**A:** Either I have not cleared it or I have cleared it quite a while back by the time I make this centralized guide that I have clean forgotten the details. I can try to recover it by jotting down all that I remember but it will not be a complete guide. Also, I will not go and redo the trial just to do up a guide as most trials are TIME-CONSUMING and I am just your typical salaryman...

**Q:** I do not meet the requirements for pulling off the strategies mentioned in the guide.  

**A:** If you are willing to spend money(applicable to only games with gacha), throw in the money to get all the good stuff out. This will make the game's contents MUCH easier.  

But if you are a cheapskate, free-to-play player like me, depending on your luck with the gacha, it may take you MONTHS of gacha draws and level/stat grinding to even be able to barely scrape by. Some of my guides are only possible because I was lucky to happen to have certain stuff which are crucial for the fight. Be patient, your day will come :)
